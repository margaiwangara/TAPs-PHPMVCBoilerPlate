<p>
PHP MVC boiler plate for my future projects. This is basically the rock from which I'll build most of my PHP projects from now. All credits go to @codecourse on YouTube for a great tutorial on creating a simple MVC in PHP. Updates will be made to include more parts as I continue on my development journey. This repository contains two major folders name app and public. public contains folders for static files, app contains folders for models, controllers, and the core files linking the three together. Still being updated on 12/18/2018. More updates will come as I build up on it to fit to my project definition.<br>
